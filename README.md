The Integration-Code Repository holds files for creating a wrapper URL code (Integration Code) for their webchat AI bot application.
The reason I created this was so that I could give my clients an Integration Code branded with my business.

I had too many CNAME records in my angelcitybusiness.com DNS registrar, so I changed the domain to angelcitymarketing, which I don't use anymore.

Example of Integration Code:
<script src="https://www.angelcitymarketing.com/Integration-Code/bot-10830.js"></script>

Which was changed from Aminos.ai's code of:
<script src="https://app.aminos.ai/js/chat_plugin_ghl.js" data-bot-id="10830"></script>
